# PeepShield
Peepshield is a Chrome extension designed to protect users from shoulder surfing attacks in public environments. Using a machine learning model and webcam input, Peepshield detects unauthorized or suspicious eye presence (e.g., an extra pair of eyes looking at your screen) and blurs sensitive content in real time to ensure your digital privacy.
